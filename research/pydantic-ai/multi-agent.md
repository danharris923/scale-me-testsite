# Multi-Agent Applications in Pydantic AI

Multi-Agent Application Complexity Levels:
1. Single agent workflows
2. Agent delegation
3. Programmatic agent hand-off
4. Graph-based control flow

Agent Delegation:
- Allows one agent to delegate work to another agent temporarily
- Agents can use different models
- Usage tracking is important
- Dependencies should typically be shared or a subset

Key Characteristics:
- Agents are stateless and global
- Can pass context and usage between agents
- Supports complex interaction patterns

Programmatic Agent Hand-off:
- Multiple agents called in succession
- Application code controls agent transitions
- Agents don't need identical dependencies
- Supports flexible workflow design

Code Example Highlights:
- Demonstrate agent delegation with joke generation
- Show seat preference and flight search scenarios
- Use structured output types
- Implement usage tracking and limits

Control Flow Options:
- Simple sequential interactions
- Nested tool calls
- Stateful graph-based workflows

Best Practices:
- Use explicit type annotations
- Manage dependencies carefully
- Track and limit usage
- Design clear agent responsibilities

The documentation emphasizes flexibility in designing multi-agent systems, with progressively more complex interaction models available in Pydantic AI.
