## üß† Claude Tasks:
1. Research latest UI/UX principles for **high conversion affiliate landing pages**
2. Reference TailwindCSS UI kits, plus open-source Vercel blog templates
3. Build out the core template with:
   - Google Sheets fetcher (CSV or Sheets API)
   - Dynamic homepage grid
   - Category pages
   - Product pages
4. Use dummy content, but structure site for **easy prompt injection** of specific product niches
5. Ensure image loading is from GCS-compatible local URLs (not hotlinked)

## ü™™ Identity Context:
This template will be reused for affiliate verticals including:
- Outdoor gear
- Camping
- General clearance/deals
- Musical instruments
- Home improvement
- Women‚Äôs fashion
- And more

All will draw from the same master Google Sheet but be filtered per site.

## üîÅ Output Format:
Return a complete `/project/` folder with:
- `/components/` for React UI modules
- `/pages/` with `index.js`, `[slug].js`, `categories/`
- `/public/` with placeholder image structure for local hosting
- `/utils/` with Google Sheets parser
- `vercel.json` and `package.json` for deployment

Use only what‚Äôs necessary. Minimal bloat. Clean comments. Assume the developer may copy/paste pieces as needed.

- Pydantic AI agent that has another Pydantic AI agent as a tool.
- Research Agent for the primary agent 
- CLI to interact with the agent.


## EXAMPLES:

In the `examples/` folder, there is a README for you to read to understand what the example is all about and also how to structure your own README when you create documentation for the above feature.

- `examples/cli.py` - use this as a template to create the CLI
- `examples/agent/` - read through all of the files here to understand best practices for creating Pydantic AI agents that support different providers and LLMs, handling agent dependencies, and adding tools to the agent.

Don't copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.
