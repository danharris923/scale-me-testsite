# React Homepage Documentation

React Core Concepts:
- A library for building user interfaces using components
- Allows creating interactive UIs with JavaScript and JSX
- Supports web and native app development
- Emphasizes component-based architecture

Key Features:
- Components are JavaScript functions that return UI elements
- Supports conditional rendering and list manipulation
- Enables adding interactivity through state management
- Can be incrementally adopted into existing projects

Development Approach:
- Modular design allowing independent component creation
- Supports server-side and client-side rendering
- Recommends full-stack frameworks like Next.js for complete applications
- Focuses on platform-specific user experience

Code Example Highlights:
```javascript
function Video({ video }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Thumbnail video={video} />
      <h3>{video.title}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
```
